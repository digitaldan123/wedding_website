# My first wedding website
An attempt to learn Ruby on Rails and avoid the typicaly mailing of invitations for my wedding.

## Getting started
Below are some quick commands to get the site up and running

```
bundle install
rails db:setup
rails server
```

## Adding users via CSV
By going to the following url (available in the admin page) an admin can import a large amount of guests (additive to the existing guests)

site/import/index

A sample csv is provided in tests/stock_guests.csv
